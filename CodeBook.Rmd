# Introduction

R code run_analysis.R performs 5 steps of the project tasks:

* 1) All data is merged using the rbind() function. Create three data sets: x(test+train), y(test+train), s(test+train). 
* 2) Mean and standard deviation measures are taken from the entire data_x data set. Columnes are renamed based on info taken from features.txt.
* 3) Activities IDs in "data_y" dataset are substituted with names taken from activity_labels.txt and they are substituted in the dataset.
* 4) Final data set is created by merging all three data sets, columns are renamed.
* 5) Finally, we generate a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type (30 subjects * 6 activities = 180 rows). The output file is called final_data.txt.


# Variables

* x_trn, y_trn, x_tst, y_tst, s_trn and s_tst -  contain raw data from the downloaded files.
* data_x, data_y and data_s - merged data of train and test tables for each group.
* features  - contains names for the data_x dataset, which are applied to the 
* mean_std - column names.
* activities - activities anmes.
* merged -  merges  data_x, data_y and data_s datasets.
* final_data - average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
