The code takes all the data (test and training) present in the same folder.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations that was performed to get tidy data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. Can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called final_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
